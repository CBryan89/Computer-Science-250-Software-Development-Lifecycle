How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by carefully analyzing client requirements, asking clarifying questions, and translating those needs into user stories. User stories are powerful because they break down high-level requests into smaller, testable goals with clear acceptance criteria. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, user stories guided development by ensuring that features like filtering vacation packages or adding “Wellness Travel” categories were aligned with the Product Owner’s expectations. They also provided a shared “Definition of Done,” helping the team know exactly when a feature was complete and ready to deliver.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to program development emphasizes collaboration, iteration, and adaptability. Using Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and backlog refinement allows for consistent feedback and rapid course correction. During the SNHU Travel project, tools like Azure Boards supported sprint tracking and visibility, while Scrum events fostered communication and alignment with the Product Owner. In the future, I plan to incorporate Agile practices such as continuous integration, test-driven development, and iterative sprint reviews to ensure transparency, maintain quality, and deliver incremental value throughout the Software Development Lifecycle.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means contributing not only through code but also by supporting collaboration, communication, and accountability. In Agile projects, this includes sharing progress openly, helping resolve blockers, and respecting the roles of teammates. During the SNHU Travel project, effective teamwork was achieved through daily check-ins, clear documentation, and responsiveness to Product Owner feedback. Good team members ensure that the team remains aligned, productive, and focused on delivering a product that truly meets user needs.
